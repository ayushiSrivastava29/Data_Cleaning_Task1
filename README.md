# Netflix Dataset Analysis and Cleaning

This project involves cleaning, analyzing, and preparing a Netflix dataset using *Python* and *pandas*. It demonstrates data handling, fixing missing values, and preparing the dataset for further analysis or visualization.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- The dataset contains Netflix shows and movies information such as:
  - show_id
  - type (Movie/TV Show)
  - title
  - director
  - cast
  - country
  - date_added
  - release_year
  - rating
  - duration
  - listed_in
  - description
- The dataset is downloaded from Kaggle.

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook

## ðŸ”¹ Steps Performed
1. Loaded the dataset using pandas.
2. Checked for missing values and data types.
3. Fixed data types (e.g., converting date_added to datetime, duration to numeric).
4. Cleaned missing values (imputed or dropped where necessary).
5. Saved the cleaned dataset as netflix_cleaned.csv.

## ðŸ“ˆ Analysis
- Compared TV Shows vs Movies.
- Filtered shows by country or year.
- Performed basic statistical analysis.

## ðŸ“‚ Files
- netflix_original.csv â€“ Raw dataset
- netflix_cleaned.csv â€“ Cleaned dataset
- data_cleaning.ipynb â€“ Jupyter notebook with all steps

## ðŸ“Œ How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ayushiSrivastava29/Data_Cleaning_Task1

2. Open data_cleaning.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.


3. Run all cells to reproduce the cleaning steps.
